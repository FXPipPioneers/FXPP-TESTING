# Discord Trading Bot

## Overview
This project is a professional Discord bot designed for trading signal distribution, automatic Take Profit (TP) and Stop Loss (SL) calculations, and comprehensive statistics tracking.

The project aims to streamline signal dissemination and performance analysis for trading groups.

## User Preferences
- Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
- Bot owner restricted to Discord ID: 462707111365836801
